The locking mechanism implemented will only work if there is a single instance of this application running. 

An external locking mechanism would need to be used if multiple instances are running  

### Testing

UUIDs for the sample wallets will be displayed in the logs as app is starting up

#### Postman
A sample postman collection has been created and added to the test resources folder
